<h1>presto</h1>

<p>
presto is a small web server implemented using chibi-scheme.
It is written for my own personal fun and education.
My aim is not actually to create another web server, but rather
to explore some concepts that are helpful in systems such as
web servers, concepts the scheme programming language was originally
developed to explore, but which were apparently thrown by the
wayside because alternate, substitute concepts emerged instead.

<p>
While I'm tinkering with this, I will also use this project as
a foundation for rewriting some python/uwsgi/nginx webapps I
created a couple of years ago that need a new lease on life.
This is to ensure my investment in this toy project, and keep me
interested when things go slow.
